# marine_heat_wave_prediction
According to Wikipedia, a marine heatwave is a discrete prolonged anomalously warm water event. The requirements for warm water events to be described as MHW are a duration of 5 or more days, temperatures greater than the 90th percentile of 30 year local measurements, no more than 3 days of cooling, and occurring in a specific region.
